## Overview

I am a full-stack junior web developer looking for a role in where I can use my problem-solving skills and passion for technology to build things that make a difference.

Having spent 4 years as a content producer in corporate events, I transitioned to software development in 2020, determined to find a new challenge which would still allow me to continue the development of my commercial, analytical and leadership skills.

I have recently completed an intensive 12 weeks bootcamp at Makers Academy and have grown from an interested amateur coder into a confident junior developer competent in a variety of languages and frameworks. Since completing the course, I have begun learning python and swift whilst working on projects.

## Skills

#### Fast learner

Makers was an intensive bootcamp with new languages and frameworks being introduced almost weekly. My ability to learn quickly was crucial and is highlighted above in my projects, such as having to learn React Native in just two weeks to complete our final project. I also undertook several external reviews during the Makers Academy to track my learning and these can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YCXU7qQ-00xYIjbRS3MYh2gvCsNX4QDP).

#### Team player

Daily pair programming, code reviewing and multiple group projects across the 12 weeks of Makers Bootcamp helped me to develop my skills as a collaborative programmer. Teamwork was also key in my extremely deadline-driven previous career. Events require efficient coordination between stakeholders, internal and external, and being willing to take the initiative and do extra work in order to ensure success was key. 

#### Attention to detail

Whilst in corporate events, I worked closely with marketing teams and wrote a number of articles, all of which required high levels of attention to detail and microscopic proof reading to ensure that everything was ready to be published. It is clear that this is a skill that will be vitally important for me in TDD when writing accurate and DRY code as well as when debugging.

#### Communication 

Communication has always been at the forefront of my previous roles. That’s included having the confidence to cold call potential clients and create a rapport, deliver presentations to high level groups, and coordinate between multiple teams and stakeholder groups using my interpersonal skills. I have successfully enjoyed working with a variety of senior colleagues and stakeholders from middle management to senior government and elected officials.
