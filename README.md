## Overview

A full-stack junior web developer.

Having spent 5 years as a content producer in corporate events, I transitioned to software development in late 2020, determined to find a new challenge that would develop my personal and professional skills and open up new opportunities for the future.

I have recently completed an intensive 12 weeks bootcamp at Makers Academy and have grown from an interested amateur coder into a confident junior developer competent in a variety of languages and frameworks.

## Skills

#### Fast learner

The makers bootcamp was intensive and fast paced with new languages and frameworks being introduced almost weekly. As is highlighted in my projects board below, I successfully learnt and developed my skills in these different technologies rapidly and efficiently.

#### Team player

I have worked in big and small organisations and have always found that the key to success is being a supportive team player who constantly looks to contribute positively in any way possible. This was key in the events world which are extremely deadline driven which often rely on coordination between multiple teams and stakeholder groups. Team work was also a key component of the Makers bootcamp. Daily pair programme and multiple group projects across the 12 weeks has helped me to develop my skills as a collaborative programmer.

#### Attention to detail

During my time in corporate events, I worked closely with marketing teams and wrote a number of articles, all of which required high levels of attention to detail and microscopic proof reading to ensure that everything was ready to be made public. In my short programming career to date, it is clear that this is a skill that will be vitally important for me when writing accurate and consistent code.
