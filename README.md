I am on course to become a full stake Ruby developer and am currently learning the fundamentals of software development with Makers Academy.

Having spent 5 years as a content producer in corporate events, I have recently transitioned to software development, determined to find a new challenge that would develop my personal and professional skills and open up new opportunities for the future.

On a macro level, software development provides endless career opportunities as an already digital world becomes further digitally engrained. On a micro level, software development provides the opportunity to create, to develop projects from initial conception through to final execution and it offers all the excitement, frustration and reward that comes with challenging problem solving. For these reasons and many more I'm extremely excited by the opportunities ahead.

## Skills

#### Team player

I have worked in big and small organisations and have always found that the key to success is being a supportive team player who constantly looks to contribute positively in any way possible. This was key in the events world which are extremely deadline driven which often rely on coordination between multiple teams and stakeholder groups.

#### Fast learner

Having been at my first company for only 4 months, I was given responsibility for the key portfolio because of the aptitude and success that I had demonstrated in the short time I had spent there. This encouraged me to continue to learn and develop my skills and, ultimately, grow the value of the portfolio in the time I was there.

#### Attention to detail

During my time in corporate events, I worked closely with marketing teams and wrote a number of articles, all of which required high levels of attention to detail and microscopic proof reading to ensure that everything was ready to be made public. In my short coding career to date, it is clear that this is a skill that will be vitally important when putting together programmes.
